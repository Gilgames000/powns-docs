# Tokenomics

1 million created, hard cap

ĐNS can be converted to xĐNS to receive rewards - ĐNS is bought back at market price with 100% of the DOGE accumulated from sales using a smart contract and provided to xĐNS holders through the [staking system](https://app.dogedomains.wf/stake). This means, for each domain sale, there is a corresponding purchase of ĐNS (the purchases are aggregated).
