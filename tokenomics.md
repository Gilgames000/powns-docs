# Tokenomics

1 million created, hard cap

LNS can be converted to xLNS to receive rewards - LNS is bought back at market price with 100% of the BCH accumulated from sales using a smart contract and provided to xLNS holders through the [staking system](https://app.bch.domains/stake). This means, for each domain sale, there is a corresponding purchase of LNS (the purchases are aggregated). 

33% of circulating supply at launch will be used to provide liquidity.

## Tokens locked in staking: 35% of total or 350,000

These tokens will never be publicly available on the market. They are held in a smart contract which can only sell staking earnings in exchange for MIST for xMIST holders. At launch, this means at minimum 70% of all available tokens are staked and earning revenue for xMIST holders. After one year, this amount will fall to a minimum of 35%.
