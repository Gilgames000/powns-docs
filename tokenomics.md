# Tokenomics

1 million created, hard cap

POWNS can be converted to xPOWNS to receive rewards - POWNS is bought back at market price with 100% of the DOGE accumulated from sales using a smart contract and provided to xPOWNS holders through the [staking system](https://app.ethwdomains.wf/stake). This means, for each domain sale, there is a corresponding purchase of POWNS (the purchases are aggregated).
