# Registrar Frequently Asked Questions

## About the UNIWENS Registrar

### How many transactions are required to register a .ethw name?

The registrar uses two transactions (commit and reveal) to register a name.

### How long does it take to register a name using the .ethw registrar?

It takes less than 5 minutes to register a name, including a 1-minute delay between the first and second transactions to prevent frontrunning.

### Do we need to do anything to ensure the continued use of existing UNIWENS names?

Make sure you renew your UNIWENS names before they expire! You add registration years to any name at any time, and for any duration you'd like.

### What happens if I have several UNIWENS names with different renewal dates?

You can add registration years to many names at a time on your My Account page in the UNIWENS Manager App.

### How do renewals work?

Anyone can add registration years to any existing name by paying the required fee, at any time.

There is no maximum limitation of the renewal duration but there is a minimum renewal period of 28 days.

### Can someone grab my domains at the end of my subscription period?

You can renew your name at any time during the period you own it. Making sure you renew before the name expires will prevent someone else from registering the name.

There is also a 'grace period' of 90 days after your name expires. You can renew the name to retain ownership of it during the grace period.

### How much will the yearly renewals cost?

Yearly renewals cost 1ETHW/year for names that are 5 characters or longer. 4 character names cost 10ETHW/year, 3 character names cost 100ETHW/year, 2 character names cost 1,000ETHW/year, and 1 character names cost 10,000ETHW/year.

### What happens to the renewal fees? Do I get them back?

Rather than being locked and held, as in the original interim registrar, renewal fees in the permanent registrar are spent. You will not get them back.

### How will UNIWENS team manage and spend the funds?

UNIWENS is decentralized, there is not a centralized treasury. MistSwap and mainnet\_pat are both major investors and are incentivized to continue developing and improving UNIWENS over time.

### How are funds from .ethw registration income used?

Funds are used to purchase UNIWENS on MistSwap and given to those who [stake UNIWENS](https://app.ethwdomains.wf/stake).

### Where can I manage all my UNIWENS names?

Simply go to [app.ethwdomains.wf](https://app.ethwdomains.wf) and click on "My Account".

### Can I trade UNIWENS domains on NFT exchanges?

Yes, .ethw names are tradeable as NFTs.

### How can I transfer domains registered in the .ethw registry to someone else?

You can do this using [our Manager interface here](https://app.ethwdomains.wf), or using any tool with NFT support.

### What prohibits large scale domain grabbing besides registration fees?

The cost of doing this is the only limitation in place.

### What is the "registrant" and "controller" of a name?

The registrant is the account that owns the .ethw name. They can transfer ownership to another account, and they can replace the controller address. The registrant is the owner of the NFT token that represents the name.

The controller is the account that controls day-to-day operations with the name: creating subdomains, setting the resolver and records, and so forth.
